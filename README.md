draw-this
is an idea generator web-app for drawing or creating in general.

The main functionality is to randomly draw a certain number of phrase-cards from the database and display them to the user. This is what happens in the landing page of the site.

    by clicking a settings button the user can choose the level of detail of the cards as well as the language of the database (english or portuguese(BR))

the gallery page displays uploaded user drawings labeled with the cards which inspired them.

Creating an account leads the user to a "home" page in the app and opens access to additional features:
    - bookmarking favorite card draws in the main page.
    - uploading images to be displayed in the gallery.
    - and creating you own personal databases, or decks of cards, which can then be drawn from in the main page and shared with friends.
